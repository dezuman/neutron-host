Don't forget to run build.sh to compile the smart contracts used in testing! 

Note that since parts of contract repos aren't tracked by git parts can be left when switching branches, and this can cause contract build errors. These are harmless, but can be fixed by simply deleting the folder of the offending contract (That doesn't actually exist in your current branch).
